# **EBS Transliteration Front-End Application**
Transliteration is the systematic process of converting text from one writing system to another, with an emphasis on accurately representing the phonetic sounds of the original language in the target script. This process maintains the pronunciation of words rather than their meanings, thereby facilitating the correct vocalization of terms across linguistic boundaries.Reading an unfamiliar language presents significant challenges. However, transliteration can facilitate comprehension by providing a means to approximate the original phonetic sounds.
# Technologies used
React Js.  
Tailwind CSS.
